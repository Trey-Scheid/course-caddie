## Why should I support Course Caddie?

Course Caddie increases justice for students and faculty! For at risk students this tool would prove essential and additionally beneficial. Students who don't have the energy/focus (mental health), resource knowledge (first generation), or course balance (skill gaps) will have an added source for accessible, practical and customized course information. This helps to level the playing field considering how other information streams can be complicated or targeted for specific majors and people, Course Caddie crosses these borders based on all possiblities and previous occurrances. 

Faculty encounter side effects from the student focused initiative. For small and unique courses more awareness can be generated through the suggestions. Course Caddie should increase the likelihood of students enrolling in courses that they will be successful, interested and active in: this reduces drops and failing grades. Course Caddie has the added benefit of earlier knowledge about student enrollment behavior, this can improve resource allocation.

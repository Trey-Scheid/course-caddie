# The Future of Course Caddie

Post deployment/evaluation at UC San Diego, Course Caddie could be expanded to other schools. The framework is highly integrated into the university system which includes a lot of sensitive information: it would not be safe. However the principles contain thought processes that students do use and should generalize well if the data is available elsewhere. This system is dependent on an orgnaized and accessible database, therefore some schools may be better equipped to have a well performing model, many ethical considerations will have different choices in different places as well. Therefore, in order to expand a team/company would likely be needed to customize the solution for each customer to continue to do good and not harm!

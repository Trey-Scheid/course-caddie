# About Course Caddie
This project was completed by Trey Scheid in June 2024 for an undergraduate data ethics course at the University of California, San Diego for professor David Danks. 

# About Data Ethics

This course covered the stages of a data science effort and gave me the tools to think critically about what potential issues could arise. This preparation enables me to design projects which will increase justice for stakeholders and limit the biases present in my deployments. If you notice the structure of the analysis I hope you can learn about the types of questions to ask about your own projects and the possible solutions or tradeoffs to explore. Data ethics is a nuanced, application specific domain which is evolving with tools but has foundational skills you can learn that will prepare you for any situation.

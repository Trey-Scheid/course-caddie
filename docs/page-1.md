# Data

What data might be useful to predict someones best next courses to take? In general it may look like: degree program, previous courses (including how they performed and if they liked it), and most importantly, what is being offered. 

    This challenge requires historical data of student enrollments, academic performance, details about students as people, and lastly scraped information about each department (offerings and requirements). Previous enrollment and current requirements are the bare minimum to address the challenge while information about individuals and past performances on enrollment data aims to improve and personalize recommendations (this is a tradeoff with added responsibility).

Additional sources that could be considered include Capes, sets, and ratemyprofessor for course and faculty ratings to truly mimic and reduce student selection process.

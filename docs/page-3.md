# Deployment

As mentioned previously, this model will only be deployed at UCSD

# Prediction Use

describes appropriate and inappropriate contexts-of-use for the model
H. explains how to interpret the model’s outputs, perhaps in a context-sensitive manner
J. describes and explains at least two potential situations—contexts, uses, etc.—in which the
model should be updated or revised (perhaps no longer using it) for ethical reasons

In use cases, the system would need current/active access to department offering pages, web-reg, and student academic histories / degree audits. 

Being deployed in a secure-sign-on environment the main ethical concerns relate to the quality of predictions more than the security and privacy. For example it would be difficult to misuse the recommendations beyond simply overreliance, but incorrect or uninterpretable suggestions could be confusing or harmful towards students' lives. This might occur disproportionately against specific majors due to complexity or availability of requirements. Similarly, then ratings could lead to classes and professors not being recommended at all (just but not fair), or too much (impacted classes).

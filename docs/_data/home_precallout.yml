  <span class="title is-5">Why Me?</span>

  Do you enroll in courses multiple times a year?

  Do you have requirements you need to graduate?

  Do you have hobbies, work or other interests besides staring at the course catelog and degree audit?

  Preparing for enrollment appointment times is a frustrating, stressful, boring and yet necessary task all students face regularly. Some say they don't care, some create rigid plans, and others enjoy the process. No matter your relationship with course selection, there is room for course recommendations in your workflow.

  <span class="subtitle">The Problem</span>

  The pain points expressed above indicate some common themes; students waste time on course enrollment prep due to repetitive research. They check the same requirements pages, course offerings sites, web reg and for some, their personal spreadsheets as well. Each time they are looking to optimize for the same things, check off requirements, find fun classes that are offered and they meet the prerequisites. This makes it an appropriate setting for ML application, although there still lies many challenges in the various data sources (types and access). 

  <span class="subtitle">The Solution</span>

  This system will find between 1 and 10 courses to a student personalized to their major, experience and the current offerings. The goal will be to reduce time and stress for students, but measured by a proxy: whether the recommendations are used.
